    <h1>The American Indian Movement</h1>
  
    <br></br>
  
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>The American Indian Movement was founded in 1968. The original purpose of this movement was to help Native Americans that were put into poor parts of cities after they were forced from their reservations by the government. However, the movement later seeked to help Indians in all aspects of life, from economic independence to protection of their legal rights. </p>
  
    <h2>Leaders</h2>
  
  <h3>Dennis Banks</h3>
  <p> Dennis Banks was a co-founder of the American Indian Movement. He led the protest at Wounded Knee, which was one of the most dangerous protests, alongside Russel Means in the 1970s.</p>
 
     <h3>Russel Means</h3>
  <p>Russel Means was an Oglala Sioux activist, actor, and writer who led protests at Mount Rushmore and Wounded Knee in the 1970s. These protests had varying levels of success.</p>
  
  <h2>Events</h2>
  
  <h3>Wounded Knee II</h3>
  <p>Wounded Knee II was a protest that involved the Oglala Indians, the Oglala chairman, and the government. The Oglala Indians claimed that the Oglala chairman was selfish and focused more on money than helping the tribe. This led to a 10-week long protest at Wounded Knee that resulted in the government sending FBI agents and Federal Marshals to end the conflict. This protest occured in the Spring of 1973, and was important because it was one of the longest and most dangerous protests. This event led to many leaders of the movement getting arrested, as it was not a peaceful protest. As a result, Wounded Knee II was not effective. 
 
  <h3>The Longest Walk</h3>
  <p>The Longest Walk involved native people of all types, and the government. It was a five-month protest in which several different Native Americans marched from San Francisco to Washington D.C. to spread awareness about lingering issues in their lives, one of them being that they were forced from their homelands. This event happened in July of 1978, and it was important because it was one of the last major events of the movement. This protest worked as it spread awareness about the problems American Indians faced in their lives, encouraging people to help the movement.
